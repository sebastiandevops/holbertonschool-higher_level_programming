# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Foundations - Higher-level programming ― Python

by Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School

## Author’s disclaimer

### Welcome to the Python world!

After 3 months of C, you will start Python today.
The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

Enjoy!

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

    Why Python programming is awesome
    Who created Python
    Who is Guido van Rossum
    Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
    What is the Zen of Python
    How to use the Python interpreter
    How to print text and variables using print
    How to use strings
    What are indexing and slicing in Python
    What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8

## Requirements
### Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Shell Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
    All your files must be executable

### C Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded

### Zen

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

#### Install PEP8

Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code, but at school we will use PEP8, version 1.7.* Don’t worry, pycodestyle is based on pep8. The hardest part now is to install it for Python 3:
Regular Ubuntu 14.04 install
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pep8
```
#### Using Pip3
#### Install Pip3
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
#### Install Pep8
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install -Iv pep8==1.7.0
```
-> Make sure you have the right version
```
$ pep8 --version
1.7.0
$
```
Finally, if you can’t make it work, please use the “container-on-demand” tool to “PEP8” your files in a pre-configured container.

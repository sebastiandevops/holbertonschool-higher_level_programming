# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Foundations - Higher-level programming ― Python

## Background Context
Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects

### Starting from today:

    Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
    The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
    Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases

## Resources

### Read or watch:

    doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
    doctest – Testing through documentation
    Unit Tests in Python

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### General

    Why Python programming is awesome
    What’s an interactive test
    Why tests are important
    How to write Docstrings to create tests
    How to write documentation for each module and function
    What are the basic option flags to create tests
    How to find edge cases

## Requirements
### Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is
    Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files should end with a new line
    All your test files should be inside a folder tests
    All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
    All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
    We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
